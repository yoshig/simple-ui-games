===============

A number of games created using JQueary UI and Javascript.

* Towers of hanoi is a game where you must move the pieces from one tower to another tower. [See the full instructions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)
* Tic-Tac-Toe is played only with two users, no UI involved (for now).
* Snake is the game that everyone in my high school played on their Nokia bricks. It was the greatest. Now you can relive that kind of nostalgia through this game!

To play games, just move the html file into Google Chrome (or another browser, but let's face it, Chrome is just so much sweeter than most others...).
